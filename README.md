# Hi, I'm Jakub 👋

## a.k.a. Wujo

I am an **Aspiring Game Developer** and **student** based in Lublin, Poland. Amongst hundreds of hours put into Skyrim and games alike, I find myself enjoying match-3 the most...

I describe myself as a "jack of all trades" in game development. A friend once called me:
> *"The idea guy that actually does something."*

Though I have a preference for combining game/level/quest design with strong **project management**, **documentation** skills, and coding/working on the engine, as much as I am able to. I believe that a well-written documentation is just as important any other aspect of the game :)

## Tech Stack
My primary engine is **Godot**, supported by a versatile toolset for 2D/3D art and verified agile workflows.
