# Hi, I'm Jakub 👋
### a.k.a. Wujo

I am an **Aspiring Game Developer** and **student** based in Lublin, Poland.

I describe myself as a "jack of all trades" in game development. A friend once called me:
> *"The idea guy that actually does something."*

I combine creative design with strong **project management**, **documentation** skills and coding/working on the engine, as much as I am able to. I believe that a well-written Game Design Document (GDD) is just as important as clean code.

### Tech stack
My primary engine is **Godot**, supported by a versatile toolset for 2D/3D art and production management.
